GROUP BY is a clause in SQL used to group rows that have the same values into summary rows.
Its commonly used with aggregate functions (such as COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), etc.) to perform calculations on the grouped data.
Heres how GROUP BY works:

**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/
Syntax:

SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1;

**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/
Example:

Consider a table named sales with columns product and quantity_sold:

product	    quantity_sold
Apple	        10
Banana	        20
Apple	        15
Orange	        30
Banana	        25

To calculate the total quantity sold for each product, you can use GROUP BY:

SELECT product SUM(quantity_sold) AS total_quantity FROM sales GROUP BY product;

Result:

product	    total_quantity
Apple	        25
Banana	        45
Orange	        30

**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/
Explanation:

The GROUP BY product clause groups the rows in the sales table based on the values in the product column.
The SUM(quantity_sold) aggregate function calculates the total quantity_sold for each product group.
The result is a summary of total quantity_sold for each unique product.

**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/
Common Usage:

Grouping data to perform aggregate calculations, such as total sales, average prices, etc.
Summarizing data for reporting purposes, such as monthly sales totals, product categories, etc.
Analyzing data to identify patterns or trends, such as customer preferences, popular products, etc.

**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/
Notes:

You can group by multiple columns by separating them with commas in the GROUP BY clause.
Columns in the SELECT list that are not part of the GROUP BY clause must be aggregated or included in an aggregate function.
GROUP BY is a powerful tool in SQL for summarizing and analyzing data, allowing you to generate meaningful insights from your database tables.

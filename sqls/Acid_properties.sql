The ACID properties are a set of four essential characteristics that ensure reliability and integrity in database transactions.
These properties guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably and consistently, even in the event of system failures or errors.
Heres what each property stands for:

**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/
1. Atomicity:

Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit of work. Either all of the operations within the transaction are successfully completed, or none of them are. 
If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database is restored to its state before the transaction began.

Example: In a bank transfer transaction, if money is deducted from one account, it must also be added to the recipients account.
If the transfer fails midway, the entire transaction is rolled back to maintain data consistency.

**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/
2. Consistency:

Consistency ensures that the database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction.
In other words, transactions bring the database from one consistent state to another consistent state.
Constraints, rules, and relationships defined in the database schema must be preserved during transactions.

Example: In a database where a students grade cannot be negative, if a transaction attempts to update a students grade to a negative value,
it would violate the consistency property, and the transaction would be aborted.

**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/
3. Isolation:

Isolation ensures that the execution of transactions occurs independently and concurrently without interference from other transactions.
Each transaction is isolated from other transactions until it is completed.
Transactions must be executed as if they were the only transactions in the system, even in a multi-user environment.

Example: If two users simultaneously attempt to update the same bank account balance, isolation ensures that each user sees the balance as it was before the other users transaction started.

**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/
4. Durability:

Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and will not be lost, even in the event of a system failure or crash.
The changes made by committed transactions are stored permanently in the database and remain intact, ensuring data persistence.

Example: If a database transaction updates a customers address, the new address will be retained in the database, even if the database server crashes immediately after the transaction is committed.

Importance of ACID Properties:

Ensures data integrity and reliability in database transactions.
Provides a framework for building robust and resilient database systems.
Guarantees consistent and predictable behavior, even in complex and concurrent transactional environments.

In summary, the ACID properties are fundamental principles that govern the behavior of database transactions, ensuring that data remains consistent, reliable, and durable under all circumstances. These properties are essential for building and maintaining high-quality database systems.

Foreign keys and primary keys are fundamental concepts in relational databases that establish relationships between tables and enforce data integrity. Lets explore each concept:

Primary Key:

A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
It ensures that there are no duplicate rows in the table and provides a way to uniquely identify each record.
By default, primary keys are indexed, which helps improve the performance of data retrieval operations.

Example:

CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50)
);

In this example, employee_id is the primary key column.

Foreign Key:

A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that establishes a relationship with the primary key or a unique key in another table.
It ensures referential integrity by enforcing a link between the data in the two related tables.
Foreign key constraints prevent actions that would violate the integrity of the data, such as inserting a value in the foreign key column that does not exist in the referenced table.

Example:

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);

In this example, customer_id is the foreign key column that references the customer_id column in the customers table.

Key Differences:

Primary keys uniquely identify rows within a single table, while foreign keys establish relationships between tables.
Primary keys are used to enforce entity integrity, ensuring that each row is uniquely identified,
while foreign keys enforce referential integrity, ensuring that relationships between tables are maintained.
A table can have only one primary key, but it can have multiple foreign keys referencing different tables.

Relationship between Primary Key and Foreign Key:

In a one-to-many relationship, the primary key column in the "one" table becomes the foreign key column in the "many" table.
This relationship ensures that each record in the "many" table is associated with exactly one record in the "one" table.

In summary, primary keys and foreign keys are essential concepts in relational databases that help maintain data integrity and establish relationships between tables.
Understanding how to properly define and use primary keys and foreign keys is crucial for designing efficient and reliable database schemas.

HAVING is a clause in SQL that is used to filter the results of a GROUP BY clause based on specified conditions.
Its similar to the WHERE clause, but while the WHERE clause filters rows before the GROUP BY operation,
 the HAVING clause filters groups after the GROUP BY operation has been performed. Heres how HAVING works:

**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/
 Syntax:

SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1
HAVING condition;

**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/
Example:

Consider the same sales table from before, and suppose we want to find products with a total quantity_sold greater than 20:

SELECT product, SUM(quantity_sold) AS total_quantity
FROM sales
GROUP BY product
HAVING SUM(quantity_sold) > 20;


Result:
product	    total_quantity
Banana	        45
Orange	        30

**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/
Explanation:

The GROUP BY product clause groups the rows in the sales table based on the values in the product column.
The SUM(quantity_sold) aggregate function calculates the total quantity_sold for each product group.
The HAVING clause filters out groups where the total quantity_sold is not greater than 20.

**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/
Common Usage:

Filtering aggregated data based on aggregate calculations, such as total sales greater than a certain amount.
Applying conditions to groups to identify specific subsets of data, such as products with high sales, customers with multiple purchases, etc.

**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/**********/
Notes:

The HAVING clause can only be used in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause.
You can use any valid condition in the HAVING clause, including comparisons, logical operators, and aggregate functions.

HAVING is a powerful tool in SQL for filtering grouped data based on specific criteria, allowing you to further refine your analysis and extract meaningful insights from your database tables.
